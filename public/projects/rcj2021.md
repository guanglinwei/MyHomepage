[Robocup Junior Soccer](https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/) is a fully automated, 2 vs. 2 robot soccer competition.

## Spongebot  

[Spongebot](https://www.livingstonrobotics.org/teams/fll/spongebot/) is a robotics team that I am a part of.  
The team started in 2013 and I joined when I was in middle school.  
We have participated in the [First Lego League](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/) and now Robocup Junior.  

## Our Robot  

Our robot uses custom-made **printed circuit boards** (PCBs) to control everything, from the motors to the sensors.  
All robot logic is run on an Arduino.  
The robot sees using a [Pixy2](https://pixycam.com/pixy2/). The convex mirror on top allows the robot to see in all directions at once.  
We use a [small LCD display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15143) to verify sensor outputs and to start/stop programs.

## Previous Competitions  

This is not our first time competing in Robocup Junior. 
Our first season was 2018. Our robots were made from wood and controlled by Android phones.  

In 2019, we upgraded our chassis to plastic and controlled the robot with an Arduino and a display screen.

## VirtualCup 2021
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was cancelled and replaced with a virtual robot simulation.  
Spongebot's code for the simulation is in the VirtualCup folder on the repo.
