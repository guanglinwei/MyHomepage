## About  

Team A.I.R is a robotics team I was a part of. We participated in a First Lego League competition under the name *Spongebots*.  
The team was renamed to Team A.I.R. as we continued to work on the Artificial Intelligence Recycler. 

## Artificial Intelligence Recycler  

The AIR uses computer vision to detect and remove recyclables from trash.

#### Convenience  
Throwing your recyclables into the correct place can be difficult and inconvenient.  
*[According to this website:](https://www.waste360.com/recycling/covanta-survey-americans-don-t-know-how-recycle)*  
- **79%** of people don't always recycle
- **62%** fear recycling incorrectly  

The AIR automatically separates plastic bottles from waste, reducing the headache.

#### Plastic Bottles  
Plastic bottles with liquid inside are significantly harder for recycling companies to deal with.  
The AIR removes liquid from bottles it detects by crushing them.  

## Global Innovation Award  

The [Global Innovation Award](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/challenge/global-innovation-guidelines) competition is an event hosted by First Lego League.  
Over 100 teams from several countries, each nominated to represent their region, apply to try to win a $10,000 grant to further develop their invention.  
The top 20 teams, which included Team A.I.R, were invited to a 2-day event hosted in Washington, D.C.
